Numerous advances in nucleic acid manipulation methods have come from the field of synthetic biology. Seamless cloning methods, such as the Gibson and CPEC (#abbr) assembly methods (#cite), enable molecular biologists to assembly plasmids of arbitrary sequences without needing to be concerned with restriction enzyme cut sites. Through reverse genetics methods, the influenza research community has had the capability to clone influenza viral segments from synthesized cDNA (#abbr)(#cite). However, the rapid mutation rate of IAV (#abbr)(#cite) may inadvertently introduce restriction enzyme sites into the influenza genome, hence complicating the process of genome cloning. Restriction cloning methods are the dominant technique in the influenza community, and hence there is an opportunity to disseminate seamless cloning protocols to improve the efficiency and rate of successful cloning for downstream applications. 

Here, we present, FluGibson, a software tool that can be used to automatically design primers for seamless cloning of influenza viral genomes.
