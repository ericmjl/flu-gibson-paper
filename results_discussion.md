To validate our primer design software, we performed the CPEC assembly method on a set of viral polymerase segments that had previously resisted successful restriction enzyme cloning, into a polymerase expression backbone, for viral assays. The four segments required were the PB2, PB1, PA and NP segments. The PCR reactions protocols were standardized across the reactions. Briefly, (#add PCR protocol + DpnI). Though non-specific banding patterns were observed (#figure), size selection of the correct band through gel purification followed by the CPEC protocol (#add protocol) resulted in successful clones, which were verified by restriction enzyme digest and sequencing (#figure, #table - from Islam). Functional assays also showed expression of the viral polymerase (#figure - from Islam).

To demonstrate the use of our software tool in the rescue of whole viruses, we cloned an H3N8 virus from cDNA into reverse genetics plasmids, using a similar protocol. Successful cloning was verified by sequencing, and TCID50 assays showed successful replication (#figure - from Chris). Finally, we assembled a panel of HA and NA viral-like particles, and successfully validated their presence in viral cells (#figure - from Wendy).
