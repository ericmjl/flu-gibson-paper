Through reverse genetics methods, the influenza research community has had the capability to clone influenza viral segments from synthesized cDNA (#abbr)(#cite). However, the rapid mutation rate of IAV (#abbr)(#cite) may inadvertently introduce restriction enzyme sites into the influenza genome, hence complicating the process of genome cloning. Advances in nucleic acid manipulation methods have come from the field of synthetic biology. Synthetic genomic methods, such as the Gibson and CPEC (#abbr) assembly methods (#cite), enable molecular biologists to assembly plasmids of arbitrary sequences without needing to be concerned with restriction enzyme cut sites. 

Here, we present FluGibson, a free and open-source software tool that can be used to automatically design primers for seamless cloning of influenza viral genomes. FluGibson serves two functions. Firstly, for the purpose of rapidly cloning viral segments, FluGibson will design primers to amplify viral cDNA, for downstream cloning into commonly-used plasmid backbones. The software package can also optionally compute a PCR protocol for PCR amplification of the necessary sequences. Secondly, for the purpose of rapidly converting one viral protein sequence into another, FluGibson will design the necessary primers and compile an assembly sequence to perform the conversion.
