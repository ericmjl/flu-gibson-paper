The software tool is implemented in the Python programming language. We implemented a graph-based algorithm for primer design, based on the design principles for the Gibson assembly method (#cite). We assume that each DNA part of the circular viral segment plasmid that need to be assembled together are ordered in a FASTA file in clockwise order.

Each DNA part represented as a node in a NetworkX (#cite) directed graph, where the directed edges indicate the 5' to 3' directionality of one strand. Primers are designed with 25 n.t. annealing to the DNA part, and 15 n.t. overhang with the upstream and downstream parts for a total length of 40 n.t., and are stored as node attributes. The primer total length can be specified (#TODO), though 40 n.t. is selected as a default as cost-effective primer ordering options exist for this primer length (#cite: Invitorgen website).

A command-line interface (CLI) is provided. Users provide a FASTA formatted file that contains the DNA parts that they wish to amplify and stitch together. The DNA parts, listed top to bottom, are assumed to be ordered clockwise, corresponding to a single strand. The CLI provides the ability for researchers proficient in scripting to automate the production of multiple primer sets. A simple web interface is also provided for point-and-click ease of use, and is located at (#web interface address)(#TODO).
