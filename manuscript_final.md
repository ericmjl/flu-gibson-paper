# Abstract

## Introduction

Reverse genetics methods enable influenza research community to clone viruses for genetic manipulation and biochemical characterization. The influenza research community uses traditional restriction cloning to assemble the necessary plasmids. However, with modern synthetic biology methods, it is possible to rapidly assemble the reverse genetics plasmids necessary from viral cDNA. 

## Results

Here, we present a software implementation of seamless cloning primer design tools tailored for use with the influenza research community, enabling rapid and cost-effective cloning of influenza viruses into reverse genetics and protein expression plasmids. The tool, (#currently unnamed), is available as a Python package on PyPI and Anaconda, and as a web app. Using the primers designed by (#currently unnamed software tool), we were able to rapidly clone a set of viral polymerases for a polymerase assay, which previously resisted cloning attempts. (#note: any other experimental results needed?) 

## Conclusions

Our (#software name) will enable the influenza research community to assemble the necessary reverse genetics plasmids for functional viral assays at a faster pace and lower cost. The software is freely available under the MIT License, and the source code is available on Github.
